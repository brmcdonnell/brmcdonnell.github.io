summary: Use Reddit's API to collect posts from two subreddits, r/The_Donald and r/Republican. Using natural language processing (NLP), I trained a classification model to predict which subreddit a given post came from. Ultimately, my logistic regression model was able to classify the titles of the posts with 75% accuracy, 25% above the baseline model.
